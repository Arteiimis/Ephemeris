# Ephemeris
Ephemeris Integrator for Solar System

This project is currently under development. The source files are not very user-friendly.

Ephemeris: CPU and GPU Implementation of a Runge-Kutta 12-order integrator for ephemeris integration.

SolarSystem: Parameters and initial values of Solar Sytem Celestial Bodies at J2000.0 (JD 2451545.0) TDB.

  Including the Sun, 8 major planets (with 77 moons), 5 minor planets (with 8 moons),
343 main-belt asteriods(1 is also minor planet), 31 trans-Neptunians(4 is also minor planets), and 36 point-masses representing the Kuiper-belt.

  Fitted to NASA/JPL Ephemerides.
